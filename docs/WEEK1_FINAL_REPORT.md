## 🔐 Vulnerabilities Resolved

### 1. ✅ Hardcoded Credentials (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: 6 passwords exposed in `docker-compose.yml`

**Solution**:
- Removed all hardcoded credentials
- Created `.env.example` template
- Secrets management guide (138 lines)
- Pre-commit hooks prevent future leaks

**Impact**: **CRITICAL → RESOLVED**

---

### 2. ✅ Exposed Database Ports (HIGH)
**Problem**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO accessible from internet

**Solution**:
- Closed 6 critical database ports
- Added network segmentation (backend + monitoring)
- Created strict security variant (docker-compose.secure.yml)
- Automated security testing

**Impact**: **HIGH → RESOLVED**

---

### 3. ✅ No Secrets Management (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: No enterprise secrets management system

**Solution**:
- Automated rotation scripts (rotate-secrets.sh, 395 lines)
- Backup/restore capability (restore-secrets.sh, 126 lines)
- Production K8s guide (K8S_EXTERNAL_SECRETS_SETUP.md, 588 lines)
- AWS Secrets Manager integration
- HashiCorp Vault integration

**Impact**: **CRITICAL → RESOLVED**

---

### 4. ✅ Network Isolation Missing (HIGH)
**Problem**: All services on single flat network

**Solution**:
- Backend network for internal services
- Monitoring network for observability
- Internal-only database access
- Automated network security tests (test-network-security.sh)

**Impact**: **HIGH → RESOLVED**

---

### 5. ✅ WASM Stub Executor (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Security tests passing falsely with stub implementation

**Solution**:
- Production Wasmtime 22.0 executor (309 lines)
- CPU time enforcement via fuel metering
- Memory quota enforcement with ResourceLimiter
- Filesystem isolation via WASI preopens
- Network restriction (no socket imports)
- Resource usage tracking

**Impact**: **MEDIUM → RESOLVED**
