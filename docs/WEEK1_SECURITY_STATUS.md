## 📅 Day 1 Status - October 21, 2025

**Time**: 11:50 AM UTC  
**Status**: 🚨 **SECURITY EMERGENCY MODE ACTIVE**  
**Branch**: `security/emergency-fixes` created ✅

### Actions Taken This Hour

✅ **1. Branch Creation**
- Created `security/emergency-fixes` branch
- Status tracking document initialized

🔄 **2. Hardcoded Credentials Audit** (IN PROGRESS)
- Scanning all files for hardcoded credentials
- Identifying all instances requiring remediation
- Creating comprehensive .env.example template

⏳ **3. Secrets Management Design** (NEXT)
- Will create .env-based secrets for local development
- Will document K8s External Secrets pattern for production
- Will create secrets rotation procedure

### Current Task
**Removing hardcoded credentials from docker-compose.yml**

### Files Being Modified
- `docker-compose.yml` - Remove all hardcoded credentials
- `.env.example` - Create comprehensive secrets template
- `docs/SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md` - Document secrets handling
- `.gitignore` - Ensure .env is never committed

### Next 2 Hours Plan
1. ✅ Remove all hardcoded credentials from docker-compose.yml
2. ✅ Create .env.example with all required secrets
3. ✅ Update .gitignore to prevent .env leaks
4. ✅ Create SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md documentation
5. ✅ Add pre-commit hook configuration

## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- ⚠️ **None yet** - Just started

### Identified Risks
1. 🟡 **Wasmtime API Complexity**: May need more than 2 days for full integration
   - **Mitigation**: Will create detailed implementation plan on Day 1-2
   
2. 🟡 **Docker Networking Changes**: May affect local development workflow
   - **Mitigation**: Will create clear documentation and docker-compose variants
   
3. 🟢 **Credential Rotation**: May need to update deployment scripts
   - **Mitigation**: Will document all affected systems
