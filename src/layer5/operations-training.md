### Tools and Commands

#### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check system health
kubectl get pods -l app=layer5 -n project-chimera
kubectl logs -f deployment/layer5-refinement -n project-chimera

# View metrics
kubectl port-forward svc/layer5-service 9090:9090 -n project-chimera
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics

# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -l app=layer5 -n project-chimera
```

#### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Deploy new version
./src/layer5/deploy-production.sh v2.1.0

# Check deployment status
kubectl rollout status deployment/layer5-refinement -n project-chimera

# Rollback if needed
kubectl rollout undo deployment/layer5-refinement -n project-chimera
```

#### Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
# Check integration health
kubectl exec -it deployment/layer5-refinement -n project-chimera -- curl http://layer4-service:8080/health

# Analyze performance
kubectl exec -it deployment/layer5-refinement -n project-chimera -- curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep optimization

# Check buffer status
kubectl exec -it deployment/layer5-refinement -n project-chimera -- curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep buffer
```

## Assessment

### Knowledge Check Quiz
