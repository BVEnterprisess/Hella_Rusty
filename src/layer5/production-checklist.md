- [ ] Network connectivity between layers confirmed
- [ ] Redis cluster accessible and healthy
- [ ] Monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana) operational
- [ ] Alerting rules configured and tested
- [ ] Backup systems verified and tested

### Application Readiness
- [ ] All unit tests passing (cargo test)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Security scans completed (no critical vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Docker images built and pushed to registry
- [ ] Configuration validated for production environment

### Team Readiness
- [ ] Operations team trained on Layer5 procedures
- [ ] On-call rotation established and tested
- [ ] Runbooks reviewed and accessible
- [ ] Emergency contacts verified
- [ ] Communication channels established

## Deployment Execution

### Blue-Green Deployment Process
- [ ] New version deployed to blue environment
- [ ] Blue environment health checks passing
- [ ] Integration tests run against blue environment
- [ ] Performance validation completed
- [ ] Traffic switched to blue environment
- [ ] Green environment scaled down

### Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Active service responding correctly
- [ ] All health endpoints returning 200 OK
- [ ] Metrics flowing to monitoring systems
- [ ] No critical alerts triggered
- [ ] Integration with Layer4, Layer7, Layer8 confirmed

## Production Validation (First 24 Hours)

### System Health Monitoring
- [ ] KPI processing rate within normal range
- [ ] Optimization accuracy >95%
- [ ] Error rate <1%
- [ ] Buffer usage <80%
- [ ] Processing latency <100ms (95th percentile)

### Integration Validation
- [ ] Layer4 KPI consumption working
- [ ] Layer7 optimization recommendations flowing
- [ ] Layer8 resource recommendations working
- [ ] All external API calls successful

### Performance Validation
- [ ] CPU usage within limits
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] Network I/O normal
- [ ] Storage I/O within bounds
- [ ] Response times meeting SLAs

### Business Metrics Validation
